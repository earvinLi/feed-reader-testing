This is the delivery to Udacity's *Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree* Project **Feed Reader Testing**, also my first testing project, built upon basic HTML and CSS from [here](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader). Basically, I coded the test suites testing the feeds, the toggling menu and the asynchronous function that loads feeds. The most difficult part of this project is how to write asynchronous suites with Jasmine's built-in done() function, especially defining and assigning varibles.
